> **Turn Claude Code into an autonomous offensive security operator.**

A Claude Code plugin that gives your agent structured attack methodology, persistent memory across context compactions, multi-agent coordination, and full observability — all backed by a Neo4j knowledge graph.

Battle-tested through hundreds of Hack The Box machines, contributing to a **Top #100 global ranking** on the platform.

## ⚠️ Required MCP Servers

**This plugin does not work standalone.** It requires a specific MCP server stack to function. The skills, hooks, and tracing infrastructure all depend on these services:

| MCP Server | Purpose | Required |
|------------|---------|----------|
| [**mcp-kali**](https://github.com/d0gesec/mcp-kali) | Kali Linux command execution, sessions, background tasks, proxy | **Yes** |
| **neo4j-mcp** | Knowledge graph for attack state, credentials, attempt tracking | **Yes** |
| **playwright** | Browser automation with headed Chromium + noVNC | Optional |

Run `./setup.sh` to spin up the entire stack. Without it, the plugin loads but has no MCP tools to work with.

---

## ✨ What the Plugin Adds

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Intel Graph** | Neo4j-backed knowledge graph — tracks targets, credentials, services, vulnerabilities, shells, and flags as structured data that survives context compaction |
| **Pre/Post Hooks** | Automatic tracing on every Kali MCP call — logs commands to Neo4j, extracts credentials and services from output, surfaces prior attempts before execution |
| **Strategic Compaction** | Context management for long offsec sessions — phase-aware compaction with Neo4j state preservation and rich recovery files |
| **Multi-Agent Orchestration** | Spawns parallel teammates after recon or shell access — CVE scouts, code analysts, system enumerators working concurrently |
| **Debrief & Writeup** | Post-challenge writeup generation with structured failure analysis and MEMORY.md updates |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker (with Docker Compose)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) v1.0.33+

### 1. Clone and setup the stack

```bash
git clone https://github.com/d0gesec/pownie.git
cd pownie
./setup.sh
```

The setup wizard will:
- Ask which optional services to enable (browser, telemetry)
- Detect container name conflicts and offer alternatives
- Generate `docker-compose.yml`, `.mcp.json`, and `.claude/settings.local.json`
- Pull Docker images and start the stack
- Wait for Neo4j to be healthy

### 2. Install the plugin

**Option A — Marketplace install:**

```shell
/plugin marketplace add d0gesec/pownie
/plugin install pownie@d0gesec
```

**Option B — Direct from cloned repo:**

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./pownie
```

### 3. Start hacking

The plugin activates automatically. Skills like the intel graph and strategic compaction work in the background. User-invocable skills:

- `/pownie:offsec-debrief` — generate writeup after completing a challenge

## 🔧 Setup Options

```bash
./setup.sh              # interactive — choose components
./setup.sh --all        # everything (browser + telemetry)
./setup.sh --core-only  # just kali + neo4j
./setup.sh --build      # build from source instead of pulling Docker Hub images
./setup.sh --down       # stop containers

./cleanup.sh            # stop containers, keep data
./cleanup.sh --volumes  # also wipe neo4j data and workspace
./cleanup.sh --full     # remove everything including generated files
```

### Custom prefix

If you already have `pownie-*` containers running (e.g. from another project), setup detects the conflict and asks for an alternative prefix:

```
! Existing containers found using prefix 'pownie':
  pownie-kali                    (running)
  pownie-neo4j                   (running)

? Choose a different prefix (or press Enter to use 'pownie' anyway): pownie-dev
✓ Using prefix: pownie-dev
```

All generated files — compose, `.mcp.json`, hooks — will use the chosen prefix.

### Build from source

By default, setup pulls pre-built images from Docker Hub. To build from the Dockerfiles in `docker/`:

```bash
./setup.sh --build
```

This clones [mcp-kali](https://github.com/d0gesec/mcp-kali) from GitHub during the Docker build.

### How the hooks work

Every Kali MCP tool call flows through the hook pipeline:

1. **PreToolUse** (`trace.sh`) — queries Neo4j for prior attempts, known credentials, disproven attack classes, and active strategies on the target IP. Surfaces this as context so the agent avoids repeating failed approaches.

2. **Agent executes command** via mcp-kali

3. **PostToolUse** (`trace.sh`) — logs the command and result to Neo4j, auto-extracts credentials and services from output, prompts for phase classification, detects shell acquisition and repeated failures.

4. **PreCompact** (`pre-compact-save.sh`) — before any context compaction, queries Neo4j and writes a rich `compact-state.md` with targets, credentials, failed attempts, and command history for post-compaction recovery.

## 🔍 Telemetry (Optional)

Enable the telemetry profile during setup to get Grafana + Tempo for trace visualization. Useful for debugging skills and hooks during development.

```bash
./setup.sh  # answer 'y' to "Enable trace viewer"
```

Then open Grafana at `http://localhost:3000` → Explore → Tempo → search by `service.name = pownie-pre-hook`.

The hooks emit OTLP spans for every Kali MCP call regardless — telemetry just gives you a UI to browse them. Without it, spans are silently dropped with zero impact on functionality.
